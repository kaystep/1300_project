This project was about me learning some of the basics of the React ecosystem. Along the way I realized that there was also a lot of ES6/Javascript syntax, Redux, Youtube API management, bootstrap integration etc... to be learned as well. The end product ended up being a basic YouTube clone that allows users to search for videos and creates a side-bar list view much like YouTube does. Overall, I accomplished my goal of learning some of the basics of React so I have a better understanding of it before I enter my internship. I would also like to credit Stephen Grider's React basic course for guiding me along the way.

Running list of React ideas I learned
  1) A react app is just broken down into numerous reusable components
  2) In order to update a component we must update it's setState
  3) Index is the most parent component and everything flows down from that
  3) There are function based components and class based components
  4) When integrating with Bootstrap use className NOT class...
