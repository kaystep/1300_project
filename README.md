Running list of React ideas I learned
  1) A react app is just broken down into numerous reusable components
  2) In order to update a component we must update it's setState
  3) Index is the most parent component and everything flows down from that
  3) There are function based components and class based components
  4) When integrating with Bootstrap use className NOT class...
